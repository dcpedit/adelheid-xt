## Instructions

### Solder all BAV70 diodes to the PCB (D0 - D63)
#### Pre-tin a single pad
Below are before and after pictures of a solder pad before and after pre-tinning a single pad for D0
[<img src="images/diodes/un-tinned-pad.jpg" height="480" />](images/diodes/un-tinned-pad.jpg)
[<img src="images/diodes/tinned-pad.jpg" height="480" />](images/diodes/tinned-pad.jpg)

#### Solder down the single leg to the pre-tinned pad
Position the diode using a pair of tweesers, and solder the leg to the pre-tinned pad. See [this image](images/grip.jpg) for additional reference.
[<img src="images/diodes/tacked.jpg" height="480" />](images/diodes/tacked.jpg)

#### Solder remaining legs to their pads
[<img src="images/diodes/soldered.jpg" height="480" />](images/diodes/soldered.jpg)

### Solder Kaailh hot swap sockets
Similar to how the diodes are soldered, pre-tin a pad.
[<img src="images/sockets/tinned_socket.jpg" height="480" />](images/sockets/tinned_socket.jpg)

Place the socket in place and apply heat with a soldering iron so it heats both the tab on the socket and the pad. Take care that you've positioned the socket in the correct orintation so it does not block the center hole (see [this image for an improperly positioned socket](images/sockets/bad_position.jpg)).
[<img src="images/sockets/solder_side.jpg" height="480" />](images/sockets/solder_side.jpg)

Using a soldering iron, apply heat and solder to the other tab of the socket. Take care not to add too much solder as it may flow into the part of the socket meant to recieve the leg of the key switch (see [this image and note that the void in the tab is full of solder and the solder has begun to flow on top of the tab](images/sockets/full.jpg), indicating that the solder is about to flow into the switch socket).
[<img src="images/sockets/solder_other_side.jpg" height="480" />](images/sockets/solder_other_side.jpg)

Note that in the image above, the soldering iron is about to come in contact with the socket to the left, which would cause it to melt. To avoid this, solder the sockets into place by collumn, working from opposite side of the hand you use for your soldering iron.

### Solder Mill-Max headers, pins for Blackpill. 
Solder the Mill-Max sockets into place. The plastic sockets/headers go on the back and the pins pins are soldered from the front.
[<img src="images/millmax/socket.jpg" height="480">](images/millmax/socket.jpg)
[<img src="images/millmax/socket_solder.jpg" height="480">](images/millmax/socket_solder.jpg)

Place masking tape over headers. A heat resistant masking tape (like kapton) is used in the photo below. 
[<img src="images/millmax/masking.jpg" height="480">](images/millmax/masking.jpg)

Optionally, poke holes in the masking tape using the tip of sharp tweezers to make the next step easier.
[<img src="images/millmax/tweeze.jpg" height="480">](images/millmax/tweeze.jpg)

Push all 44 Mill-Max pins into place with tweezers.
[<img src="images/millmax/pinned.jpg" height="480">](images/millmax/pinned.jpg)

Position Blackpill over the headers/masking tape with the pins protruding though the holes and solder into place.
[<img src="images/millmax/solder_pill.jpg" height="480">](images/millmax/solder_pill.jpg)

### Slowly remove Blackpill
Be careful not to bend any pins.
- Try to lift up evenly on all sides.
- Sliding a plastic spudger between the blackpill and the PCB may help.

Remove the masking tape. Now is a good time to flash your Blackpill with the [Adelheid XT firmware](https://github.com/dcpedit/adelheid-xt/tree/master/firmware) if you haven't already. Push the Blackpill back in place.

### Solder OLED header into place.
Just like the Mill-Max sockets, the plastic header will be on the front, and pins will be soldered in from the back.
[<img src="images/oled/header.jpg" height="480">](images/oled/header.jpg)

### Solder EC11 rotary encoder. 
Similar to the headers, encoder is on the front, while pins are soldered from the back.
[<img src="images/ec11/ec11_placed.jpg" height="480">](images/ec11/ec11_placed.jpg)
[<img src="images/ec11/solder_ec11.jpg" height="480">](images/ec11/solder_ec11.jpg)

### Place M2x8 spacers
Mount spacers on bottom of the board over the mounting holes and secure them tightly with M2x4mm screws. It is recommend to use blue Loctite on the screws to prevent them from loosening as they will be hard to retighten once the plate/switches are installed.

[<img src="images/spacers/loctite.jpg" height="480">](images/spacers/loctite.jpg)

[<img src="images/spacers/spacer.jpg" height="480">](images/spacers/spacer.jpg)

### Install 2u stabalizers
Note that the bar for the number pad enter key crossses over the screw head for one of the M2x8 spacers. Double check this spacer is well fastened before installing the stabalizer.

### Attach switch plate (top plate)
Push a switch in each corner of the switch plate, and push them into place onto the PCB.

[<img src="images/switch_plate/switch_plate.jpg" height="480">](images/switch_plate/switch_plate.jpg)

Push the rest of the switches in one column at a time, starting from the left column.  This is where a plate support fork will come in handy.

### Optional - LED for light-up star
Hand solder wire + 470 resistor + LED to the 3.3v (long pin) and GND (short pin).  Resistor can go anywhere in the circuit.  Wrap exposed wire/pins with electrical tape and tape into place. 


[<img src="images/backlight/backlight.jpg" height="480">](images/backlight/backlight.jpg)

### Optional - Aluminum case feet 
Attach the aluminum case feet to the two large holes on the bottom plate, or you can just use 2 extra rubber bumpers instead if you want a case with no typing angle.

[<img src="images/feet/feet.jpg" height="480">](images/feet/feet.jpg)

Attach 4 rubber bumpers to the lower edge of the bottom plate.

### Finishing touches
Secure bottom plate to spacers with the remaining M2x4mm screws, and insert OLED screen into the header on top of board.
